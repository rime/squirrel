# How to Rime with Squirrel

> Instructions to build Squirrel - the Rime frontend for macOS

## Manually build and install Squirrel

### Prerequisites

Install **Xcode 14.0** or above from App Store, to build Squirrel as a Universal
app.

Install **cmake**.

Download from https://cmake.org/download/

or install from [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

``` sh
brew install cmake
```

or install from [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

``` sh
port install cmake
```

### Checkout the code

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rime/squirrel.git

cd squirrel
```

Optionally, checkout Rime plugins (a list of GitHub repo slugs):

``` sh
bash librime/install-plugins.sh rime/librime-sample # ...
```

Popular plugins include [librime-lua](https://github.com/hchunhui/librime-lua), [librime-octagram](https://github.com/lotem/librime-octagram) and [librime-predict](https://github.com/rime/librime-predict)

### Shortcut: get the latest librime release

You have the option to skip the following two sections - building Boost and
librime, by downloading the latest librime binary from GitHub releases.

``` sh
bash ./action-install.sh
```

When this is done, you may move on to [Build Squirrel](#build-squirrel).

### Install Boost C++ libraries

Choose one of the following options.

**Option:** Download and install from source.

``` sh
export BUILD_UNIVERSAL=1

bash librime/install-boost.sh

export BOOST_ROOT="$(pwd)/librime/deps/boost-1.84.0"
```

Let's set `BUILD_UNIVERSAL` to tell `make` that we are building Boost as
universal macOS binaries. Skip this if building only for the native architecture.

After Boost source code is downloaded and a few compiled libraries are built,
be sure to set shell variable `BOOST_ROOT` to its top level directory as above.

You may also set `BOOST_ROOT` to an existing Boost source tree before this step.

**Option:** Install the current version form Homebrew:

``` sh
brew install boost
```

**Note:** with this option, the built Squirrel.app is not portable because it
links to locally installed libraries from Homebrew.

Learn more about the implications of this at
https://github.com/rime/librime/blob/master/README-mac.md#install-boost-c-libraries

**Option:** Install from [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

``` sh
port install boost -no_static
```

### Build Squirrel

* Make sure you have updated all the dependencies. If you cloned squirrel with the command in this guide, you've already done it. But if not, this command will update submodules.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* There are a few environmental variables that you can define. Here's a list and possible values they may take:

``` sh
export BOOST_ROOT="path_to_boost" # required
export DEV_ID="Your Apple ID name" # include this to codesign, optional
export BUILD_UNIVERSAL=1 # set to build universal binary
export PLUM_TAG=":preset‚Äù # or ":extra", optional, build with a set of plum formulae
export ARCHS='arm64 x86_64' # optional, if not defined, only active arch is used
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='13.0' # optional, lower version than 13.0 is not tested and may not work properly
```

* With all dependencies ready, build `Squirrel.app`:

``` sh
make
```

* You can either define the environment variables in your shell/terminal, or append them as arguments to the make command. For example:

``` sh
# for Universal macOS App
make ARCHS='arm64 x86_64' BUILD_UNIVERSAL=1
```

## Install it on your Mac

### Make Package

Just add `package` after `make`

```
make package ARCHS='arm64'
```

Define `DEV_ID` to automatically handle code signing and [notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) (Apple Developer ID needed)

To make this work, you need a `Developer ID Installer: (your name/org)` and set your name/org as `DEV_ID` env variable. 

To make notarization work, you also need to save your credential under the same name as above.

```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials 'your name/org'
```

You **don't** need to define `DEV_ID` if you don't intend to distribute the package.

### Directly Install

**You might need to precede with sudo, and without a logout, the App might not work properly. Direct install is not very recommended.**

Once built, you can install and try it live on your Mac computer:

``` sh
# Squirrel as a Universal app
make install
```

## Clean Up Artifacts

After installation or after a failed attempt, you may want to start over. Before you do so, **make sure you have cleaned up artifacts from previous build.**

To clean **Squirrel** artifacts, without touching dependencies, run:

``` sh
make clean
```

To clean up **dependencies**, including librime, librime plugins, plum and sparkle, run:

``` sh
make clean-deps
```

To clean up **packages**, run:

``` sh
make clean-package
```

If you want to clean all above, do all.

That's it, a verbal journal. Thanks for riming with Squirrel.

## Build with CMake

Alternatively, Squirrel can be built with CMake.

(Note that universal binaries are not supported, and Xcode command line tools are still required.)

```sh
# Prepare librime
make -Clibrime deps
bash librime/install-plugins.sh hchunhui/librime-lua lotem/librime-octagram rime/librime-predict  # and more...

# Build squirrel
cmake -S. -GNinja -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0 -DDEV_ID='YourDevID'
cd build
ninja          # Create build/Squirrel.app
ninja sign     # Code-sign build/Squirrel.app (*)
ninja package  # Create package/Squirrel.pkg (*)
ninja install  # Directly install to '/Library/Input Methods' (*)
```

(*) `sign`, `install`, and `package` require code-signing `DEV_ID` or `SIGN_KEY` to be set. `SIGN_KEY` will take precedence over `DEV_ID`.
